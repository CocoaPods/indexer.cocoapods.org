# Contributing to this indexer

> project status: in development

Hey there ðŸ™Œ thanks for wanting to collaborate on the search indexer for CocoaPods.

We are currently making the transition from the existing search infrastructure to a new one where periodically the whole pods database will be read, and replicated in Algolia.

On top of that, we will also listen to webhooks and replicate those immediately.

To contribute or have a mirror on your own Algolia account you'll need:

1.  an Algolia account, with its API keys
2.  access to the postgres database of CocoaPods

Feel free to contact us if you're interested!
